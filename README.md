# Kickstart My Chart
## Backgroud
Over $2 billion has been raised using the massively successful crowdfunding service, Kickstarter, but not every project has found success. Of the more than 300,000 projects launched on Kickstarter, only a third have made it through the funding process with a positive outcome.

Getting funded on Kickstarter requires meeting or exceeding the project's initial goal, so many organizations spend months looking through past projects in an attempt to discover some trick for finding success.

## Objectives
Use the Excel table provided, modify and analyze the data of 4,000 past Kickstarter projects as you attempt to uncover some market trends.

---
## Results
1. Category Analysis
2. Sub-Category Analysis
3. Monthly Analysis
4. Outcome Analysis

## Conclusion
* Projects started on kickstarters.com are more likely to be successfully funded, since there are more successful projects (53%) than failed and canceled projects (46%).

* Music and theater are the two industries that investors like to invest. Projects in those industries have a higher successful rate (77% and 60%).

* It seems approximately 8% of the total projects would be canceled for unknown reasons.

## Limitation
The dataset might be too small to be representative. There are approximately 450000 projects listed on kickstarters.com. Only 4113 projects were included in this dataset, which merely accounts for <1%.
